    description:
      "Eons of spreading evil without being able to destroy me is proof of I'm <span>more solid than an Accept album</span>. Furthermore, my <span>alien biology</span> grants me <span>complete regeneration</span> in a short period of time. Not being subject to the <span>limitations of human physics or biology</span> is what it's all about. However, I can be affected by <span>magic or external agents</span>, and I can be harmed or even defeated, but <span>not permanently</span>. A guarantee that <span>I'll always be</span> at my job (or in your nightmares) 24/7.",

    title: 'Inmortality',
    description:
      "Like me, those of us considered <span>the Great Old Ones</span> are like that, <span>eternal and untainted by deterioration</span>. We don't wear down and are always at our prime age to start an Armageddon or drive the enemies of our cults mad. We're <span>older than Judas Priest's career</span>. And if we sleep for a few thousand years, it's only to <span>return with even more strength and malevolent energy</span>. The blood contract you sign is for all eternity, baby.",

    title: 'Tentacles',
    description:
      "One of my strong suits, without a doubt. Many, <span>many tentacles</span> for different twisted functions, imagine that. Giant wings are fine, I wouldn't trade them for anything, but a good handful of tentacles brightens your day. <span>The workload is multiplied</span> if you have tentacles instead of just two poor arms. <span>Dave Lombardo</span> always confessed that if he'd had <span>tentacles instead of arms</span>, every <span>Slayer album would be a rhythmic symphony</span> impossible for a miserable human brain to assimilate. Maybe one day I'll grant him his poisoned desire.",

    title: 'Arcane Magic',
    description:
      "Interdimensional magic, blasphemous rites, and the power of having inspired a literary work like the <span>Necronomicom</span> have validated me two doctorates: <span>'Ritual Black Magic Applied to Cosmic Disasters'</span> and <span>'Arcana and Extraterrestrial Powers for Monstrous Deities'</span>. Despite having centuries of experience, I'm still learning the ominous universe of magic. For example, I recently earned the prestigious (and top-secret) Master's degree in <span>'Pentagrams of Non-Euclidean Dimensions, Venom Album Covers and Other Ignominious Figures for Arcane Rituals'</span> from <span>Miskatonic University</span> in <span>Arkham, Massachusetts</span>. Never stop learning evil, that's my motto",

    title: 'Terrifier',
    description:
      "Being more dangerous, huge, ugly and awesome than the <span>Megadeth lineup from 'Peace sells...'</span> makes it easy for me to terrify the average human. I can morph my appearance to fit the <span>necessary nightmarish size</span>. Of course, my reptilian wings, claws, and scaly appearance, in addition to my nontrivial octopod-like features, give me the qualities to have been among the <span>10 Most Terrifying Entities</span> in any universe in the last 4 billion years (annual list compiled by the prestigious magazine <span>'The Pnakotic Manuscripts</span>').",
